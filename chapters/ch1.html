<p>Every kid fancies having superpowers, but few want them for revenge. Leo was one of the few.
Say if he had the ability to control water, he would have his bullies’ faces rinsed by the murky water from the pond that they were about to throw him into. But since he cannot control water, or any property of nature for that matter, Leo braced himself for another impromptu swimming practice.</p>

<p>Richard and Kyle’s routine began in early Spring, when the ice around Roth Middle School just began to melt. They would hold Leo by the legs, upside down as they shook him for his pocket money. Then on the count from three, swung him into the half frozen pond. Leo did not know how to swim. His parents tried teaching him countless of times in his youth. They eventually gave up, for he was always too tense and poorly coordinated. But within an hour of exposure to the school pond, Leo learned to swim.</p>

<p>'<i>Today was no different, was it?'</i>' Leo wondered as he surfaced from the water. Then he caught a glimpse of what appeared to be a black haze, right BELOW HIM! He jolted backwards; the haze followed. Something broke through the blackness that was when Leo realized, it was a person! A girl with long dark hair drowning. How could he not have noticed someone else was in the pond too before? He reached out to grab her, but her thin wrist slipped through his grip. She must be drowning deeper, he dove his head into the water but she was nowhere to be seen. The pond was not so deep that something could sink into an abyss. The bottom was clearly visible. Leo looked around him, he was alone. When he surfaced he saw the girl again. Exactly right where she was before. While, Leo had also considered himself brave. This was just getting a little too strange, in hurried large messy strokes he retreated back to land.</p>

<hr />

<p>When Leo arrived home that afternoon, his father was yelling as his mother held a fruit peeler to his father’s face. Nothing special to see, for his parents’ bouts are a bi-daily spectacle. One night, he asked his mother, why they are still together. She said “it is for you. That even though we no longer loved each other, we still loved you.” Are parents aware that when they make proclamations of self sacrifice, their child does not feel loved, but guilt. Leo was not an accident, but a choice. It’s his parents, who choose to adopt him, but somehow he still cannot help feeling it is all his fault that they are unhappy. He is the nuclear glue keeping protons together that would have otherwise happily repelled each other. With the strong force upon his shoulders, Leo tread up the stairs and into his room.</p>

<p>Leo’s room was a small nook in an appended ceiling. There was a contractible desk, aligned along the one of the two beds. On of them was his, the other bed belonged to his mother, who for the last few years have started sleeping in his room. There was a body length mirror perpendicular to his desk. His cubicle bookshelf was filled with an assortment of textbooks and wires. Both clothing rack and laundry hamper were fairly empty, for most of his clothes were deposited on his bed. By the time his mother returned at night, she was too exhausted from a day at the shop and arguing with his father to bother Leo about his mess. Leo turned on his laptop as he flopped into the bed and shifted around to find a comfortable position amongst the heap of clothing. While waiting for his computer to boot, Leo looks up at the body length mirror and screams.</p>

<p>The drowning girl from the pond was in the mirrow; she followed him home.</p>

<hr />

<p>Antanee always knew something big would happen when she turned twelve. For most girls it was the age of developments, of first kisses and training bras. For Antanee, she hoped it would be when her recessive telekinetic powers awaken and she will be taken away to a special academy to train. But she also had enough sense to bury such fantasies to the recesses of her mind. Disappointingly her powers did not surface. Guess she will just have to settle to being able to see her twin brother (or so she both assumed, that’s who he was) on reflective surfaces.</p>

<p>The first time she saw him was in her school's bathroom, where she hid to avoid __. She had also been one of the stalls crying for sometime, until she finally pulled herself together to wash her face and re-apply her eyeliner.</p>

<p>When Antanee looked into the mirror, the reflection she sees is not of herself, but that of a boy. There he was staring back at her, he looked familiar but she is certain she never met him before. There he was staring back at her, eyes wide and mouth agape. His full red cheeks summoned an urge in her to pinch them. Antanee subconsciously reached forward towards the mirror.</p>

<p>“Don’t you come any closer,” a voice rang out. She looked around, but found no one else in the room. “Who... who is this," she called, her voice shaky. “Where are you?” She said again, this time trying to sound assertive.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked the voice from before.</p>

This time she noticed the lips of the boy in the mirror move to the question. Now, there was no mistaking from whom the voice came from. But there was still the question of from where. Even though it seems the voice is from the boy in the mirror, no sound emitted from the mirror. Of course, a mirror cannot emit sound! It only reflections light, Antanee was sure of this. “It almost seems your voice is coming from...” She paused, unsure how to finish that sentence. It happens often, she struggles to find the right words to match her thoughts, even in ordinary conversations. (Not that she had conversations with anyone on a regular basis.) “When you speak, it is almost as if,”</p>

<p>“I am a voice in your head”, finished the boy in the mirror. “That is how I hear you too.”</p>

<hr />

<p>Leo decided she must be a ghost, what other explanation can there be?! There she was, inside his mirrow. There she was, long dark hair draped like a veil over her shoulders. Red lips stood boldly against the ghastly pale skin. She was in a white blouse and navy plaid shirt, the uniform Ravensworth Prep. Leo could tell she was ‘one of those kids’; the ones who costumed themselves to ponder about death. But if you looked carefully into her eyes, there was something Leo could not put his finger on, soemthing contradictory. Beyond the thickly outlined black eyes, her irises were darker than black, a pair of tiny obsidian spheres, you can almost see your own reflection in them.</p>

<p>“What’s your name? How long have you been alive?” Leo finally asked. From her clothes and make-up, she couldn’t have passed away too long ago.</p>

<p>She blinked and looked bewildered. Leo realized he was asking the wrong question. “I mean how long have you existed?” He corrected himself. For you see, if you were to ask ghosts how long they have been alive, they would tell you the age at which he died. But existence sums up the years both before and after death.</p>

<p>“My name is Antanee. I am twelve and...” she pause and biting her lower lip with her teeth. “Let’s see... my birthday was on October 10. If I am calculating correctly, I am twelve years and 182 days old!”</p>

<p>Wow, impressive! Not for her ability to do mental math, but because she seems to know exactly what day today was. Most ghosts lose all sense of time after death. They would often be obvious to what decade they were in, let alone the exact month and date.  “Wait!” Leo said with a sudden giddy tone. “Did you just say your birthday was on October 10th?” She nods. “Mine too!” he exclaims. This is very exciting news for Leo. He had gotten used to thinking, that he shared nothing in common with any other human being. And here is someone who shared his birthday and age! Now Leo did not know chances of meeting someone with the same birthday is not as unlikely as it would seem. Out of section five dozen people, it is very likely any two of time will share the same birthday.
He suddenly became very eager to help the girl, who once shared his birthday. I better just be direct,  he thought. Ghosts just don’t casually show up in your mirrors. They have always have a purpose. Leo looked at Antanee determined, and said “By the way call me Leo. So, how may I help you seek vengeance?” And unable to contain his curiosity adds, “Why did you chose me?”</p>

<hr />

<p>If the boy in the mirror was a representation of herself, he had to be her subconscious. Revenge was something Antanee had not thought about in a long time. It used to occupy her mind all the time, when she would daydream about getting back at the kids who picked on her. No matter how many schools she’s transfer into, her classmates always found something about her they can make fun of her for. Nana did not look very highly on the notion of revenge. </p>
<p>“Vengeance is the custom of little people. Just hold your head up high, a proud lady should smile even at her offenders”, she said as she wiped the tears from Antanees cheeks. “Retribution is not ours to deliver anyway. God sees all, and He will fairly pass judgement on all their actions."

<p>Ousted from most local church organizations for her question on practices, nevertheless her grandmother was the most genuinely religious person Antanee knew. A true Lutherian at heart, "sola fida, sola scriptura", by faith and scripture alone one may seek salvation Nana insisted.</p>

<p>“I am not looking to seek vengeance on anyone.” Antanee answered Leo.</p>

<p>“On your death. Whoever or whatever that killed is what bounds you here right?” he clarified.</p>

<p>“I am not dead!” Antanee declared, almost yelling into the mirror. Now she sees why he was asking all these peculiar questions. He thought she was a corpse or a ghost. Surely she had the complexion a Poe lady; and if she was ever to be one of them, Antanee fancied herself a Ligeia.</p>
