What can we change around?
- Greda ends with thief girl
- Show a deep platonic friendship between girl and boy that does not necessarily turn into romance
- Kai ends with Snow Queen, shows a loving relationship between older woman and younger man

- X-over with bubble/foam spirit (Little Mermaid)
- Starts with Mirror Story, about Greda and Kai developing their friendship over the mirror
Then one day Kai starts changing, and disappears. When Greda looks into the mirror now, she sees nothing
not Kai anymore, not even herself.

* This is a story about Greda in a journey of self discovery, to recover her lost identity in the absence of Kai.

Antanee meets thief girl alot earlier, while she is hiding from an attack. The beast gets tamed by the bandit family. Thief girl, eventually gets known as tamer of the wild.

Since the spliters were splinters of glass that ended up in Kai's eyes.

The omnipresent narrator can be the Snow Queen, herself who sees everything in the world through mirrors and reflexive surfaces.

Even in SQ, Greda and Kai had a psuedo-sibling relationship. The SQ could have wanted Kai by her side, because she saw how optimistic he was. What she did not know was the darkness that was in his heart, which started to arise before she came to fetch for him. (Don't judge a book by it's cover?)
